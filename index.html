            <h1>Objective</h1>
            <p>
                Transforming Open Source software engineering into a successful and sustainable process, able to provide the foundations on top of which build up the digital transition of our society, requires being able to enroll as much additional help as possible to manage the software and the surrounding community.
            </p>
            <p>
                But hiring more programmers is not a practical solution given the large number of projects to fund, the shortage of professional programmers and the well-known challenges of onboarding new members into an ongoing project. 
                Instead, BOSS advocates for hiring help for free4 and fully available on-demand in the form of swarms of smart bots as the only scalable solution. Therefore, the main objective of this project can be stated as:
            </p>
            <p class="text-center fw-bold">
                Building, One Bot at a Time, a Unified Framework for Sustainable Software Development
            </p>
            <p>
                BOSS aims to transform software development by providing a revolutionary unified framework. This framework will model, generate, personalize, combine and coordinate smart software bots to help in all phases of software development and maintenance, with a strong emphasis on the specific challenges and characteristics of “Open Source-driven” projects, i.e., projects that are Open Source or that heavily rely on Open Source projects. Which, in fact, as argued before, is almost any relevant software project nowadays. And even more in the future, due to the own European directives to promote Open Source.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following figure illustrates this change of perspective, highlighting how we go from the current developer-centric view to a fully open environment where different types of bots (and coordinated swarms of bots) interact with all kinds of member profiles to advance the project in a way that satisfies the goals of the community as a whole. Bots will help in all types of tasks from menial ones, like welcoming new project members, to complex ones requiring AI capabilities like task prioritization or favoring the project diversity.
